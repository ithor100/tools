    <h1>Code camping in the time of Corona</h1>
    <p>This is a bit of a braindump and a journal and a way of coping with two major events that entered my life recently.</p>
      One was fully planned and accounted for: 
  </br>
  Becoming a participant of  <a href="https://codecampleipzig.de">Code Camp Leipzig</a> for 3 months from mid-March until mid-June 2020.
    </p>
    <p>The other event come out of the blue:</br>
    The Coronavirus and the massive unfurling of events and measures that impacted the lives of billions of people around the world.</p>
    <h2>The situation</h2>
   <div>
     <p>
      On March 16th 2020, the German Bundesregierung and the LÃ¤nder agreed to
      impose drastic measures to slow down the spread of
      <mark>Coronavirus</mark> in Germany. Co-incidentally, that same day also
      marked the beginning of the second class of
      <a href="https://codecampleipzig.de">Code Camp Leipzig</a>.
    </p>
    </div>
    <p>
      Instead of fostering in-person interaction,
      Code Camp Leipzig needed to go remote from the second day onward.
      <b>I am happy to say that we made it!</b>

      <h2>The stack of tools we are using is small but powerful:</h2>
    </p>
    <li> <b><a href="https://discordapp.com">Discord</a></b> for <i>synchronous</i> and <i>asynchronous</i> conversations between code campers and instructor </li>
    <li><b><a href="https://zoom.us">Zoom</a></b> for our interactive lessons (more on that later on)</li>
    <li><b><a href="https://loom.com">Loom</a></b> to capture lessons and comment on them quickly</li>
