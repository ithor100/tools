# Black Swan Code Camp

## The situation
Yesterday, on March 16th 2020, the German Bundesregierung and the LÃ¤nder agreed to impose drastic measures to slow down the spread of **Coronavirus** in Germany. Co-incidentally, yesterday also marked the beginning of the second class of [Code Camp Leipzig](https://www.codecampleipzig.com). 

After having kicked off our code camp in person on this first day, #CodeCampLeipzig, which prouds itself on the analog, in-the-same-room interaction of its participants, needed to set things up to quickly **go remote from the second day onwards**.

On top of heeding advice like *"Do not touch each others keyboards!"* - something that would happen once we get into pair programming - we needed to get a **fully functional hard- and software setup** up and running quickly.

## The **stack of tools** we are using is small and powerful:
1. **[Discord](https://www.discordapp.com)** for *synchronous* and *asynchronous* conversations between code campers and instructors
2. **[Zoom](https://www.zoom.us)** for our interactive lessons (more on that later on)
3. Possibly **[Loom](www.loom.com)** to capture lesson snippets and make them immediately available to (re-)watch and comment on (at *exactly* the right time stamp in the video).

*Yes, these last two tools do sound similar, but are **not** connected and can be used to complement each other.

Depending on your own needs, you might want to add a storage space like Dropbox, Box.com, OneDrive, Google Drive or Tresorit.
